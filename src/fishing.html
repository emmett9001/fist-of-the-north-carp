    Hokuto no Huchen (Fist of the North Carp)
    <div>Made @ <a href = "http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/" target="0">Fishing Game Jam</a> // Nina Freeman (me), Emmett Butler and audio by Deckman Coss</div>
    <p>
    The inspiration for this game comes from a fishing trip I went on with my dad when I was little. He caught a sunfish and thought it would be funny to swing it around on the line. At the end of his swing the sunfish smacked me right on the cheek.
    <p>
    This game was made using Flixel, Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. You can view the <a href="https://github.com/hentaiphd/fist-of-the-north-carp" target="0">Github repository</a> and our <a href="http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=123" target="0">Fishing Jam Forum post</a>.
